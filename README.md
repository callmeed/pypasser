Py Passer
========

Python script for calculating a quarterback's [passer rating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating) 

**Why?** Because I'm learning Python and the passer rating is one of my favorite ways to learn basic new language features (it usually involves math, conditionals, function arguments, type conversions, etc.). 

How to use it
-----

From the command line: 

python qb_rating.py [attempts] [completions] [yards] [touchdowns] [interceptions]
