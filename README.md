Py Passer
========

Python script for calculating a quarterback's [passer rating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating) 

**Why?** Because I'm learning Python and the passer rating is one of my favorite ways to learn a new language (it usually involves math, conditionals, method arguments, type conversions, etc.). 

How to use it
-----

From the command line: 

python qb_rating.py [attempts] [completions] [yards] [touchdowns] [interceptions]
